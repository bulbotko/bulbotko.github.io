        <h2>History of Dogecoin</h2>
        <p>Originally formed as a "joke", Dogecoin was created by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe software engineer 
            Jackson Palmer. They wanted to create a peer-to-peer digital currency that could reach a broader demographic than Bitcoin. 
            In addition, they wanted to distance it from the controversial history of other coins. Dogecoin was officially launched on
             December 6, 2013, and within the first 30 days, there were over a million visitors to Dogecoin.com. Palmer is credited with 
             making the idea a reality. At the time, he was a member of the Adobe Systems marketing department in Sydney.
             Palmer had purchased the domain Dogecoin.com and added a splash screen, which featured the coin's logo and scattered 
             Comic Sans text.</p>
