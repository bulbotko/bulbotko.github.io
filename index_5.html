            <h2 id = "text_1">1. What is Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for goods and services. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides. Think of them as you would arcade tokens or casino chips. You’ll need to exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency to access the good or service.
                Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security.</p>
            <h2 id = "text_2">2. How many cryptocurrencies are there? What are they worth?</h2>
            <p>Nearly 15,000 different cryptocurrencies are traded publicly, according to CoinMarketCap.com, a market research website. And cryptocurrencies continue to proliferate. The total value of all cryptocurrencies on Dec. 3 2021, was about 2.6 trillion, having fallen off an all-time high above $2.9 trillion weeks earlier. The total value of all bitcoins, the most popular digital currency, was pegged at about $1.1 trillion.</p>
            <h2 id = "text_3">3. Why are cryptocurrencies so popular?</h2>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrencies appeal to their supporters for a variety of reasons. Here are some of the most popular:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Supporters see cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as the currency of the future and are racing to buy them now, presumably before they become more valuable</li>
                <li>Some supporters like the fact that cryptocurrency removes central banks from managing the money supply, since over time these banks tend to reduce the value of money via inflation</li>
                <li>Other supporters like the technology behind cryptocurrencies, the blockchain, because it’s a decentralized processing and recording system and can be more secure than traditional payment systems</li>
                <li>Some speculators like cryptocurrencies because they’re going up in value and have no interest in the currencies’ long-term acceptance as a way to move money</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>History of Shiba Inu.</h2>
            <p>
                Shiba Inu token (ticker: SHIB) is a decentralized cryptocurrency created in August 2020 by an anonymous person or group known as "Ryoshi". It is named after the Shiba Inu (柴犬), a Japanese breed of dog originating in the Chūbu region, the same breed that is depicted in Dogecoin's symbol, itself originally a satirical cryptocurrency based on the Doge meme. Shiba Inu has been characterized as a "meme coin" and a pump and dump scheme. There have also been concerns about the concentration of the coin with a single "whale" wallet controlling billions of dollars' worth of the token, and frenzied buying by retail investors motivated by fear of missing out (FOMO).
Shiba Inu was created in August 2020, dubbing itself the 'Dogecoin killer'. On 13 May, Vitalik Buterin donated more than 50 trillion SHIB (worth over $1 billion at the time) to the India COVID-Crypto Relief Fund.
The exchange price of the cryptocurrency notably surged in early October 2021. Its value increased 240% over the week. However, at the beginning of November the price dropped and continued to fall, ending the month having lost approximately 55% of its value.
